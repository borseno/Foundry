./contracts/openzeppelin/ was first pulled from https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/f9650b4cb897fe71c049902dab9975bd702b5325/contracts, then anything not needed for the FRY token was deleted. To aid in verification, the original directory structure was preserved for all files not deleted.
